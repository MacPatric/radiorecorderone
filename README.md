# radiorecorderone

RadiorecorderONE is a tool to open mp3 audio streams from an url and write them to the local filesystem.
I use this project to learn JavaScript and Node.js, so this is very much work in progress!

This project contains sub-projects:
* StreamRecorderCmd: the basic command to open a URL and write the mp3 stream to the filesystem
* StreamRecorderData: entities and structures to save meta data like the URL and the names of radio shows for further use
